<p>You may remember the classic Windows game of Minesweeper. In this
game, an N by M grid of cells was covered by opaque buttons, and K mines
were hidden under the buttons. After the initial setup for the game,
every cell is in one of three states:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A cell has a mine.</li>
  <li>It is adjacent, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to
  a cell with a mine, and keeps count of how many mines it is adjacent
  to.</li>
  <li>It is not adjacent to any mines.</li>
</ol>

<p>The user is then invited to click on one of the obscured cells to try
and discover all the mines. When a user clicks a cell, the next event
depends on the state that cell is in:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the cell is a mine (state (1)), only the cell is shown (and
  then the user loses).</li>
  <li>If the cell is adjacent to a mine (state (2)), only the cell is
  shown (the game reveals the count of adjacent mines and stops).</li>
  <li>If the cell is not adjacent to any mines (state (3)), it shows
  itself and then reveals all adjacent cells. If adjacent cells are also
  in state (3), they reveal their neighbors, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given a grid size, a description of mine locations, and a click
location, you must provide all of the cell locations that are
unobscured.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first line of input will be three integers N, M, and K. N is the
width of the playing field and M the height; K is the number of mines.
The next K lines will describe mine locations as X and Y coordinates.
The final line will be the X and Y coordinates of the clicked cell.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>You must output the X and Y coordinates of the revealed cells, one
line per cell. Output the lines ordered by X and then by Y.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>STDIN:</p>

<pre>
3 3 2
0 0
0 1
2 2
</pre>

<p>STDOUT:</p>

<pre>
1 0
1 1
1 2
2 0
2 1
2 2
</pre>
